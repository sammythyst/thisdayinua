# This Day In Unus Annus

## Description 
A memorial site for the YouTube channel, Unus Annus, who uploaded one video every day for a year until their deletion. 'This Day in Unus Annus' uses a combination of JSON and JavaScript to display details from the videos, including original thumbnails, titles, and descriptions, on their anniversary of upload as Unus Annus uploaded it during their one year existance.

## Developer Notes
- The Clock is set to end on the anniversary of Unus Annus ending, at midnight on November 14th. During the countdown, the Clock may appear to be an hour slow. This is caused by the accommodation for Daylight Savings. 
- Since the original span of Unus Annus took place during a leap year, there is a leap day video ("Top 10 Worst Things Your Friend Could Possibly Spend Their Money On"). However like the other videos, it will not appear until the anniversary of its release. The next leap year will be 2024.
