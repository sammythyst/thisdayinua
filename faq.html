        <h3>How does this work?</h3>
        <p>This site reads the date and time provided by your device using your local timezone. It uses this information to display the details from each video on the day it was originally uploaded by Unus Annus. This is NOT a reupload site, there are NO videos! Think of it as a memorial page. If you're more technical and want to see the code used, check it out on <a href="https://github.com/sammythyst/thisdayinua" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Why is the clock an hour off?</h3>
        <p>The Clock is set to end on the anniversary of Unus Annus ending, at midnight on November 14th. During the countdown, the Clock may appear to be an hour slow. This is caused by the accommodation for Daylight Savings.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What about leap year?</h3>
        <p>Since the original span of Unus Annus took place during a leap year, there is a leap day video ("Top 10 Worst Things Your Friend Could Possibly Spend Their Money On"). However like the other videos, it will not appear until the anniversary of its release, February 29th. The next leap year will be 2024.</p>
